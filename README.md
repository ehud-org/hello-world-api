# hello-world-api-server
A simple node-express api server for testing.

## what is it? 
This is a very basic JavaScript-Node-Express server that acts as the "hello world" of API-Server. 
* The server listens to port 3000 
* The server has just one endpoint "GET localhost:3000/"
* The server returns a simple JSON with payload

{
        msg: "Hellow World!"
}
~~~

Nice and simple. 

The server also includes a Dockerfile and is packaged as a container.
